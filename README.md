# üå¶Ô∏è Real-Time Weather Monitoring System

This Real-Time Weather Monitoring System is designed to track, analyze, and visualize real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Built with Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL, this project offers a dashboard for historical trends, current conditions, weather forecasts, and custom alerts. It includes a responsive UI and powerful backend logic, all packaged in a Dockerized environment for easy deployment.

## üìù Note to Reviewer:

The OpenWeather API provides a free tier that allows us to retrieve only real-time weather data and forecast information. Unfortunately, it does not support fetching historical weather data with a free API key.

To overcome this limitation, our application calculates **daily summaries** based on the **real-time weather data** collected every 5 minutes. The application fetches this data and stores it in the database. These stored entries are then used to generate both **daily summaries** and **historical data**.

Upon initial startup, the dashboard may show limited results, as it relies on real-time data being fetched. However, after the application runs continuously for **1-2 hours** or more, it will collect enough weather data, allowing the dashboard to update dynamically with more comprehensive **daily summaries** and **historical trends**, reflecting real-time conditions accurately.

This design ensures that the application functions as a **robust real-time weather monitoring system**, despite the API's limitations on historical data retrieval.

- Maven (to build the project)
- IntelliJ IDEA

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Run
Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-monitoring-system.git
    cd weather-monitoring-system
    ```

2. **Build the Application**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. **Run with Docker Compose**
   Docker Compose makes it easy to spin up the application along with its dependencies like MySQL.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4. **Access the Dashboard**
   Once the application is running, you can access the weather monitoring dashboard by visiting:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080/dashboard/dailySummary
    http://localhost:8080/dashboard/weatherForecast
    http://localhost:8080/dashboard/historicalData
    ```

## üìã API Endpoints (Use POSTMAN to test )
The following REST APIs are available:
- [API Documentaion Link](Link)
  
1. **Daily Summaries**
   - `GET /weather/dailySummary?cdate={date}`
   - Returns the daily summary for the city and date.

2. **Fetch Weather Forecast**
   - `GET /weather/forecast?city={city}`
   - Returns the 5-day forecast for the selected city.

3. **Fetch History Data**
   - `GET /api/weather/historyData?city={city}&date={date}`
   - Returns weather data for a specific city and date. 


## üìä Dashboard & Visualizations
- **Weather Data Trends:** Line charts for temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- **Weather Forecast:** Displays a 5-day forecast with weather icons and descriptions.
- **Daily Summary** Daily Summary of weather data on the basis of date.

## ‚úÖ Test Cases
Comprehensive test cases have been implemented to cover the following:
- **Weather Data Retrieval:** Verifying correct data parsing and storage.
- **Threshold Alerts:** Testing the accuracy of custom weather alerts.
- **Forecast Data:** Ensuring reliable 5-day forecast fetching.
- **Edge Cases:** Handling null data, API errors, and more.

## üöÄ Additional Features (Bonus)
- **Email Alerts:** Sends email notifications for critical weather conditions.

## üèÜ Achievements & Performance
